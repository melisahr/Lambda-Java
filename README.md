# Lambda-Java
I followed a YouTube video to understand the concept of a lambda expression.
It is a concise code that generate an instance of a functional interface. 
The goal was to create a user-defined function interface or a predefined one.
The user-defined had a interface class and an abstract method to display some messages. 
While the predefined was to create a lambda expression using the Actionlistener and 
a two JButtons. The lambda expression synthax: (argument) -> {Statement/s}.
An argument can be empty if there is no parameter in the abstract method. And the
curly brackets are added if there are more than one statements.
